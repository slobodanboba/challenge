    Software Development Company website challenge
  </div>

  <div>
    Create a website for a Software Development Company using material from links at the top and any material that you find yourself. Website has to have at least 4 custom made pages using only HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
  Home page with dropdown menu using JavaScript to open the list elements.
  Portfolio page with previous projects of that company ( more about this page at the explanation at the bottom ).
  About Page is going to be short description of that software company ( you can tell as your idea how you imagine some new startup ) and about CEO of that company (you). In that part you will tell as more about yourself and why you think that you will be good programmer.
  Contact page is going to be your contact and email form, set up to send email directly to you and google map pointing your address.
  </div>

         <div>
           Home page rules: you will have to make custom page out of HTML, CSS and JavaScript., it should be sticky main navigation menu and be able to open company portfolio dropdown list on click with JavaScript, not CSS, in JS30 there are  lessons  number 24 and 26  explaining how to do that.  You can not copy and paste any code from JS30, you should get idea how that should be done only.  All links on menu should change color on hover. Website should be fully responsive and have Flex display CSS. On the very left in navigation menu should be small “hamburger menu” icon wich on click opens into side menu to navigate thru page ( that opening should be handled with only CSS ). When display width is less than 780px, all menu should be in one column and 5 rows. Rest of the page you can fill with some random text and images (increasing opacity from 0 to 1, instead of sliding in from sides when you scroll down, like in lesson  number 13 in JS30). At the bottom you should have some simple footer menu with same links like in nav menu. It is up to you how you are going to design it. We will not focus on design, but technical part of your code. It is a plus if there is some nice design-idea-animations with CSS.
  Company Portfolio page is actually list with links to pages and on each page you should have one of the challenges that you can find in attached document 5 “FUN” CHALLENGES. This is actually only link on your nav menu that will dropdown to list of those 5 challenges. Even if you don't finish all of them, make the link to “blank” page . All those challenges are just modified challenges from JS30 and basically all answers are there. You are not required to finish all those challenges, as many you do better.

  <div>
    About page is very important for you, consider that as uploading your resume for job opportunity. In first part you will tell us more about some idea for your startup, if you don't feel like sharing, you can use existing company instead. It has to have short video of you talking about yourself and your previous experiences, as well why you consider yourself right person for this job. Upload it somewhere and should play with custom player from JS30 lesson number 11,  just add option for full screen and speed controller on side from lesson 28 . Stream on About page just after text about the company. Player should look similar to this player
  Contact page can be kind of simple contact form with info how to contact you in future and email form with basic email components. Somewhere on page add small google map pointing on your current address.
